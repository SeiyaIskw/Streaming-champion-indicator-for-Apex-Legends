## Streaming-champion-indicator-for-Apex-Legends

I made champion indicator for my streamer friend.

It is compatible for Xsplit and OBS Studio, but Streamlabs OBS is not.
  Because they don't make browser interact section. so shame.

You can push the number to increase number, and push the blank next to decrease.
Also, if you put any picture "images.jpg" next to this file, it will be appear on blank area.

***

Because of my streamer friend using Streamlabs OBS, This script may abandoned.
 And my design skill is crap. :biblethump
